The Zeller's Congruence algorithm is a mathematical formula used to calculate the day of the week for a given date.
It was devised by Christian Zeller in the late 19th century.

The algorithm takes three inputs: the year (in the range of 1583 to infinity),
the month (1-12), and the day of the month (1-31).
Here's the step-by-step explanation of the Zeller's Congruence algorithm:

Adjust the month and year: If the month is January or February,
you need to treat them as months 13 and 14 of the previous year.
For example, if the date is January 1, 2023, you would consider it as 13th month of the year 2022.

Calculate the day of the week: To calculate the day of the week, you need to use the following formula:

scss
Copy code
int h = q + 13*(m + 1) / 5 + k + k / 4 + j / 4 + 5 * j;
		h = h % 7;
Where:

h is the day of the week (0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, and so on).
q is the day of the month.
m is the adjusted month.
K is the year of the century (year % 100).
J is the zero-based century (year / 100).
Convert the day of the week to a more familiar format: The result obtained from step 2 will be a number from 0 to 6. You can convert it to a more recognizable format, such as Sunday, Monday, etc.

Here's a conversion table:

0: Saturday
1: Sunday
2: Monday
3: Tuesday
4: Wednesday
5: Thursday
6: Friday
That's the essence of the Zeller's Congruence algorithm.
It allows you to determine the day of the week for a given date using simple arithmetic calculations.
It's worth noting that the algorithm assumes the Gregorian calendar is in use and may not provide accurate results for dates before 1583 when the Gregorian calendar was adopted.
